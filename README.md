Improvements were made by Hritwik Singhal and Nishita Agarwal To the code and this is the code implementatin of Improved-LEACH Protocol.

```In LEACH protocol, the cluster heads are distributed randomly, near or far from the base station.
The random situated CH may lead to more energy consumption based on the distance between the CH and base stations.
The number of cluster heads in LEACH is varied in different rounds.
Whereas, the improved LEACH [I-LEACH] divides the network into circular clusters where every cluster has its cluster head.

The I-LEACH is based on traditional LEACH where the rounds are divided into the set-up and steady state periods. In the set-up period, the base station elects the nodes chosen as cluster heads based on their energy
level, if the energy exceeds the average energy value. The steady-state period uses the TDMA method for scheduling the data signals sent to the cluster heads and then transmitted to the base station.
